  <h1><u>EZ File Encrypter</u></h1>
  <br>
  <h2>What is the EZ File Encrypter?</h2>
  <p>The EZ File Encrypter is a light weight and reliable file encrypter. Using a simple but effective encryption algorithm, the encrypter can safely store personal files with any chosen password.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Why should I use the EZ File Encrypter?</h2>
  <p>Due to the nature of the EZ File Encrypter, even if an assailant gained access to your files they would still be protected. The EZ File Encrypter allows any file to be unreadable and protected from within your own system. Additionally, the small storage requirements of the encrypter allow the program to be ran by almost any system.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What are some possible dangers?</h2>
  <p>If you encrypt a file and delete the orginal to protect that file, ensure that you keep track of the password/key. Forgetting the password/key will cause two things: The file to incorrectly decrypt with the wrong password, and The file to be lost until the correct decryption password is known. This is a safety feature, the software will only rebuild the file with the correct password.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>How do I Encrypt/Decrypt a file?</h2>
  <p>Encrypt: To Ecrypt a file, first select a previously unencrypted file(DO NOT ENCRYPT A FILE MULTIPLE TIMES, this feature will be implemented in the future but is not yet reliable). Then select Encrypt, this will bring you to the Encryption page. Ensure you have the correct file selected, provide a password that you will remember, and click Encrypt. For large files this may take a while, but sit back and relax as your file is encrypted. Your encrypted file will end in "-EZ".</p>
  <br>
  <p>Decrypt: To Decrypt a file, first select a previously encrypted file. An encrypted file will end in "-EZ". Select Decrypt and the software will bring you to the Decryption page. Ensure you have the correct encrypted file, provide the correct file password, and press Decrypt. This process will likely take longer with large files, just sit back and relax as your file is restored.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What if I forget my file password?</h2>
  <p>If you forget your file password, make sure "Delete encrypted file on decryption" is disabled; This will be a check box when selecting to decrypt a file. Having this setting disabled will allow unlimited attempts on passwords until the file is correctly decrypted.</p>
